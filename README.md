# print\_time

A simple C++ function for printing `std::chrono::duration`s formatted to
`HH:MM:SS.mmm`

`print_time.hpp` contains two functions called `print_time`. The first
takes an integer representing number of milliseconds to print, and the
second takes an `std::chrono::duration` to print. `pt.cpp` gives a few
examples of usage.
